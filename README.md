# petalinux-multiply-device-driver
I designed and implemented a hardware multiplication peripheral using Vivado, which I integrated onto a Zybo Z7 FPGA board running a Linux operating system. The peripheral supports the multiplication of two 32-bit integers. To facilitate communication between the Linux OS and the peripheral, I developed a character device driver in C, enabling efficient data transfer and interaction with the hardware.
